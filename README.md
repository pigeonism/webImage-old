# webtoimg
An experiment to change a website into an abstract image.

With a given url supplied around line 34 (can be changed to have a method ask for user input i just chose a local loopback address), it will plot an image using html and text within the page as coordinates.

It could be an interesting way to save a page if reversed to show the page again, so that part is probably going to be added when I get around to it.

needs python3-pygame to be installed.
